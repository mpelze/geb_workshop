     Exercise 1: Write a test case that checks if adding an item to the
     backlog works (works = it appears in the backlog list at the bottom of the page).
     Hint: To do so you have to write a test case AND the page class.
    */

     Exercise 2: Make your test fail to see how nice the assertions errors are the underlying
     spock framework provides.

     Exercise 3: Write a test case that checks if removing a backlog item from the
     backlog works.
    */


    /*
     Exercise 4: Make your test cases as human readable as possible. You can add String after
     the given: when: then: marks to describe what you are doing.

     Exercise 5: Write a test case that checks if the filter field on the backlog
     page works (works = entering text in this field filters the backlog list).

    /*
      Exercise 6: You can extend your test cases to include several when: then: blocks. This can be
      used to implement scenarios. Write a test case for a simple scenario: Add a backlog item, change to
      the about page, then come back to the main page. (You will see that the added backlog item is gone
      because there is no persistence in this demo app. This is not what the user expects so your test
      should fail).
