      Exercise 1: Write a test case that checks if clicking "Page 2" on the main page really
      leads you to page 2.
      Hint: To do so, you need 2 page classes (one for the main page, one for page 2). You can check if
      you are at a specific page by using the "at" checker (e.g. then: at Page2).

    /*
      Exercise 2: Write a test case that checks if the text on the about page starts with "Lorem ipsum".
      Hint: The text is located in a <p> element that has no id. There is only one <p> element in the page
       so that is not really a problem but think about options to really find the correct <p>.
